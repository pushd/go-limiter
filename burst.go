CheckWait should be called at the beginning of the caller's action. It blocks if the limiter needs to restrict execution, otherwise it returns immediately. Restriction is typically based on consumption of a fixed rate budget, but may also be controlled by other factors.

If calls to this method are uniform, the allowed rate will roughly match the rate threshold. Non-uniform use may result in a rate during the end of an interval and the beginning of the subsequent interval which together exceed the specified threshold.
